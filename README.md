# Project 1 - 2020 Fall Machine Learning (CS-433) 
## Dataset
[Dataset available here.](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs). To load the data, use the same code we used during the labs. You can find an example of a .csv loading function in our provided template code from labs 1 and 2.

## Task
We want you to implement and use the methods we have seen in class and in the labs. You will need to provide working implementations of the following functions.
|Function|Details|
|---|---|
|least squares GD(y, tx, initial w,max iters, gamma)|Linear regression using gradient descent|
